Just An Arrowhead Mold
=================

Overview
--------

Adds an arrowhead mold to the game, with an output of 8 arrowheads; that's it! Doesn't add anything else.

There are other mods that add molds, but I couldn't find any that just added an arrowhead mold.

Note that forging arrowheads will yield more per ingot compared to the output of this mold; that is intentional.
